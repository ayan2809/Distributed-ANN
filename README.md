# Distributed ANN

An artificial neural network trained using distributed training method with
the help of open source library PyTorch. It is a classification model
and can be used for various datasets. I have trained on the diabetes 
dataset and predicted on a sample dataset as well as a custom dataset.
It uses CUDA architecture for parallelism within the GPU witht the help of
python PyTorch Library


## Deployment

To run the python file the Runtime of the Google Collab notebook should have
be GPU by doing the following

Runtime -> Change Runtime Type -> Select GPU from the dropdown

To run it locally it needs a CUDA enabled GPU

## Tech Stack

CUDA, Pytorch, Numpy, Torch Libraries
